# Cabin Camera

Your Model 3 may be equipped with a cabin camera located above the rear view
mirror.

The cabin camera can determine driver inattentiveness and provide you with
audible alerts, to remind you to keep your eyes on the road when Autopilot is
engaged.

By default, images and video from the camera do not leave the vehicle itself
and are not transmitted to anyone, including Tesla, unless you enable data
sharing. If you enable data sharing and a safety critical event occurs (such
as a collision), Model 3 shares short cabin camera video clips with Tesla to
help us develop future safety enhancements and continuously improve the
intelligence of features that rely on the cabin camera. Data may also be
shared if diagnostics are required on cabin camera functionality. Cabin camera
does not perform facial recognition or any other method of identity
verification. To protect your privacy, cabin camera data is not associated
with your vehicle identification number.

To adjust your data sharing preferences touch Controls > Software > Data
Sharing > Allow Cabin Camera Analytics. You can change your data sharing
settings at any time.
