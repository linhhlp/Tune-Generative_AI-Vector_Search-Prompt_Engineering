# Pedestrian Warning System

The Pedestrian Warning System (if equipped) causes Model 3 to emit sound when
driving below approximately 19 mph (32 km/h) or while driving in reverse.
Electric vehicles operate quietly and this sound helps to alert pedestrians of
your oncoming vehicle. The sound, which activates whenever Model 3 is shifted
out of Park, gets louder as speed increases.

Warning

If sound cannot be heard, pedestrians may not be aware of your oncoming
vehicle, which may increase the likelihood of a collision resulting in serious
injury or death. If the Pedestrian Warning System is not operating,
immediately contact Tesla.
