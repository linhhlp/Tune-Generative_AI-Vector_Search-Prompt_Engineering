## Adjusting the Front Vents

Model 3 has a unique horizontal face-level vent that spans the width of the
dashboard. Using the touchscreen, you can pinpoint exactly where you want to
direct the air flowing from this vent when heating or cooling the front cabin
area.

When the face-level vent is on you can adjust the direction of the air flow
from each vent. To adjust the direction of the air flow, simply touch the
radiating air waves from the corresponding vent on the touchscreen. The air
flows in a single stream when centered or splits into mirrored air streams
when air is directed outward or inward from the center of the vent.

Note

When you split a vent into two separate air flows, the air flow in each
direction is not as strong as when all air is flowing in a single direction.

Note

Outside air is drawn into Model 3 through the grill in front of the
windshield. Keep the grill clear of obstructions, such as leaves and snow.

## Adjusting the Rear Vents

Model 3 has vents located at the back of the center console where air flows
from when the setting is turned on from the touchscreen. To direct the flow of
air in the rear cabin area, adjust the vents at the rear of the center console
up, down, or from side to side as necessary.
