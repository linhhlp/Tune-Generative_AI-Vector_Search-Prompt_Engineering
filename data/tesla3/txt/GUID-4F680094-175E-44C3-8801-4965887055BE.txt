# Vehicle Hold

When Model 3 is stopped, Vehicle Hold can continue to apply the brakes even
after you remove your foot from the brake pedal.

Vehicle Hold will activate in two ways:

  * When the vehicle's stopping mode is set to Hold: Vehicle Hold is automatically enabled any time the vehicle comes to a complete stop.
  * When the vehicle's stopping mode is set to Creep or Roll: Vehicle Hold is enabled automatically anytime the vehicle is at a standstill and the brake is pressed.

This indicator displays on the touchscreen whenever Vehicle Hold is actively
braking Model 3.

To disengage Vehicle Hold, press the accelerator pedal or press and release
the brake pedal.
