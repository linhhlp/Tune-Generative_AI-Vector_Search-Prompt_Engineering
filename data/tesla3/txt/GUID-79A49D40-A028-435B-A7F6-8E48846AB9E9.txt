pedestrians with a variety of sounds from your vehicle's external speaker
while in Park. See Boombox for more details.

Emissions | Fun can come in surprising ways. Select your preferred fart style
and target seat. Use your turn signal or press the left scroll wheel when
you’re ready to “release” your prank. For those lucky vehicles equipped with a
Pedestrian Warning System, you can choose to broadcast externally when your
vehicle is parked. But wait-- the fun doesn't stop there! Use the mobile app
to conduct remote emissions testing by touching and holding any of the four
quick control buttons and selecting the fart button.  
Light Show | Park outside, turn the volume up, roll down your windows, then
enjoy the show. Schedule the light show for a future time and customize the
song to surprise your loved ones.

can be distracting to other road users. Before activating, it is the driver’s
responsibility to ensure the use of light show complies with local laws and
regulations.

About Your Tesla box displays SpaceX's interplanetary spaceship.  
Rainbow Charge Port | When Model 3 is locked and charging, press the button on
the mobile connector ten times in quick succession. Neat, huh?  
Rainbow Road | Need more cowbell? Visit Rainbow Road by moving the drive stalk
fully down four times in quick succession while Autosteer is enabled.  
Romance | You can’t roast chestnuts by an open fire in your car, but you can
still cozy up with your loved ones by this virtual fireplace. Cue the music
and get your romance on!  
Sketchpad | Channel your inner Picasso. Show us what you got! Touch Publish to
submit your artistic compositions to Tesla for critiquing.  
TRAX | It's never too late to follow your dream of becoming a world-famous DJ.
With TRAX, you can turn your vehicle into your own personal music studio.
While in Park, choose from an array of instruments and unique sounds to create
the next hit song. Microphone and headset are not included.  
The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything |
Rename your vehicle to 42 (touch Controls > Software and touch the vehicle's
name). Notice the new name.

the color swatch next to the vehicle name and customize the paint, tone, and
more.
