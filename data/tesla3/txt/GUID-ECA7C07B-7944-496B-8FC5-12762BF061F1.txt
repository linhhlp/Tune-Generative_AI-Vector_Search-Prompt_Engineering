## Body Repairs

If your Model 3 is in a collision, contact Tesla or a Tesla-approved Body Shop
to ensure that it is repaired with genuine Tesla parts. Tesla has selected and
approved body shops that meet strict requirements for training, equipment,
quality, and customer satisfaction.

Some repair shops and insurance companies might suggest using non-original
equipment or salvaged parts to save money. However, these parts do not meet
Tesla's high standards for quality, fit and corrosion resistance. In addition,
non-original equipment and salvaged parts (and any damage or failures they
might cause) are not covered by the warranty.

## Replacing Cabin Filters

Informational PurposesAn informational icon, calling your attention

Note

Depending on your vehicle's date of manufacture, screw may be in a slightly
different location on the cabin filter cover.

Model 3 has air filters that prevent pollen, industrial fallout, road dust,
and other particles from entering the cabin through the vents. Tesla
recommends replacing these filters every 2 years (every year in China). Cabin
filters can be purchased at the Tesla Shop.

To replace the cabin filters:

![](../../images/GUID-8EBE725E-0D52-4C1C-B8A8-55F37455663E-online-en-US.gif)

  1. Turn off the climate control system.
  2. Move the front passenger seat fully rearwards and remove the front passenger floor mat.
  3. Use a clip pry tool to carefully release the push clips that secure the front passenger footwell cover to the instrument panel. Then, while supporting the footwell cover, disconnect the two electrical connectors and move the footwell cover aside.
    * For the light, carefully press down on the tab while releasing the connector.
    * For the speaker, carefully angle the vehicle-side connector so that the small tab releases from the hole in the footwell cover-side connector while releasing the connector.

Warning IconA warning icon, calling your attention to a possibly risky
situation

CAUTION

To avoid damage, do not pull on the wires when disconnecting the connectors.
When disconnecting the connectors, make sure to pull from the plastic on the
connectors themselves.

![](../../images/GUID-156232FD-CB87-4BCF-9580-3D53B0A36B48-online-en-US.gif)

  4. Working from top-to-bottom, use a trim tool to carefully release the right side panel from the center console.
  5. Remove the T20 screw that secures the cabin filter cover to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) module, then release the cabin filter cover and move it aside. On some vehicles, the screwn is a T20/6mm hybrid fastener. Tabs may also replace the screw: use your index finger and thumb to squeeze the two tabs at the bottom of the cabin filter cover. Tilt the cover outward to remove.

Informational PurposesAn informational icon, calling your attention

Note

If the HVAC module does not have a cabin filter cover, reinstall the trim
panels and contact Tesla.

Warning IconA warning icon, calling your attention to a possibly risky
situation

Warning

Do not stretch, bend, or otherwise damage the orange High Voltage (HV) cables
that are attached to the cabin filter cover. If the HV cables are damaged,
immediately discontinue this procedure. HV shock can result in serious injury
or death.

![](../../images/GUID-7BB81837-2F41-47EC-B5AD-992FF8B93CC8-online-en-US.png)

  6. Fold the upper cabin filter’s tab upward and the lower filter’s tab downward.
  7. Holding the tab on the upper cabin filter, pull the upper filter out from the HVAC module.
  8. Holding the tab on the lower cabin filter, pull the lower filter upwards and then out from the HVAC module.
  9. Ensuring that the arrows on both new filters face towards the **rear** of the vehicle, insert the lower cabin filter into the HVAC module and lower it into place. Then, insert the upper cabin filter above it.
  10. Fold the tabs inward so that the cabin filter cover can be installed.
  11. Install the cabin filter cover by engaging the lower cover tab then securing the T20 screw or T20/6mm hybrid fastener. Tighten the screw to 1.2 Nm/0.89 ft-lbs. On vehicles with tabs instead of a T20 screw: maneuver the top notch of the cabin filter cover into place, then secure the tabs at the bottom of the HVAC module.
  12. Reconnect the two electrical connectors to the components in the front passenger footwell cover, then resecure the cover with the push clips.
  13. Align the right side panel with the front and rear locator slots on the center console, then apply pressure until all of the clips are fully secure.
  14. Reinstall the front passenger floor mat then move the front passenger seat back into place.

## Using RFID Transponders

When attaching an RFID transponder (used by many automated toll systems)
inside Model 3, place the transponder on the passenger side of the rear view
mirror as shown. This ensures best results and minimizes any obstruction to
your driving view.

## Installing Front License Plate Bracket

To accommodate jurisdictions that require a license plate on the front of your
vehicle, Model 3 is equipped with a license plate bracket. This bracket
conforms to the shape of your vehicle's front bumper and is adhered to it
using strong adhesive.

Note

Tesla recommends performing this procedure on a clean, dry vehicle during a
warm day. Cold and/or wet conditions may result in reduced performance of the
adhesive.

To install the front license plate bracket:

  1. Get isopropyl alcohol and test it on a non-visible painted surface of your vehicle to confirm that it does not damage or remove the paint.
  2. Clean the mounting site with isopropyl alcohol and allow to dry for at least one minute.
  3. Fully remove the protective tape from the adhesive at the top of the bracket and partially remove the tape from the top of the adhesive on each side. Leave the bottom half of the tape on the sides in place and fold the unattached tape outward for easy removal after aligning the bracket to the bumper.
  4. While tilting the top of the license plate bracket away from the bumper (to prevent adhering it to the wrong location), align the bottom center of the license plate bracket with the middle of the grille as shown.

Note

Be as precise as possible when aligning the bracket because you will be unable
to reposition it once adhered to the bumper.

  5. While correctly aligned, move the top of the bracket against the bumper and apply pressure so that it is held in place by the adhesive.
  6. Remove the remaining tape from the sides of the bracket then press the entire bracket firmly against the bumper, ensuring the bracket is held in place by all adhesive areas.
  7. Once the bracket is securely mounted, use the four supplied screws to attach your license plate to the bracket (tighten to 3 Nm/2.2 ft-lbs).
