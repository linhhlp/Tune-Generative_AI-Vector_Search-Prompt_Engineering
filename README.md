# Tune Generative AI with Vector Search and Prompt Engineering

1. Extract information from HTML websites and vectorize the text. Then store them in Cassandra which is provided by DataStax.

2. Prompt Engineering with Vector Search: Detail Generative AI with information and context by doing Vector Search in Knowledge Domain to generate the best candidates.

3. Clusterize Vector Search: In case of multiple input queries (list of shopping products in the past), we can suggest/recommend different products by on their clusters (group/category of products)
