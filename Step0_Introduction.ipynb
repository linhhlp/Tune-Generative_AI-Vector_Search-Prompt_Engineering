    "## Tune Generative AI with Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI is an AI model/technology that produces (generates) content including text, graphics, audio, and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI is good at generating general information, but it does not have all the information, especially, the knowledge in a specific domain (Domain Knowledge). Therefore, we will input the specialized information (in the format of a list of movies), and ask the Generative AI to select from this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "What applications are available when using Vector Search and Prompt Engineering in Language Models (LLMs)? \n",
    "\n",
    "0. Content-based retrieval: Based on the vector (embedding from the user's input), the system will identify and retrieve similar and related contents. For example, finding similar images, videos, and songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recommendation: Based on the current viewing item, suggest items similar or relevant. For example, products on shopping, movie, or song while watching or listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Semantic Search: Vector Search helps to find relevant information in a specific domain. For example, when a customer looks for an item, based on the search query, the system will return relevant items that better understand keywords because the meaning and context of the keywords are captured in the embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Question answering: Vector Search helps to find relevant information in a specific domain, then Generative AI can use this information to generate accurate information. For example, a customer asks for a specific car model, User Manuals, Operating Instructions, or client inquiries about the company's policies. This is the case of Prompt Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Accelerator: Language Models (LMs) are very expensive when running due to neural network structure in deep learning. The Vector Search can shortlist the items which are related to the current situations, therefore, reducing the resources LMs use to lower the cost of operating. This is crucial in a high level of usage/traffic. We can cache the results from Vector Search to ensure the flexibility and dynamics of LMs."
